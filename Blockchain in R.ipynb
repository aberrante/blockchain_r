    "# Transactions Through an Electronic Ledger\n",
    "Alice, Bob, and Christie understand that they will need a central electronic ledger to store all transactions. This means that they need a database or just a spreadsheet. In its simplest form their database has just one table with four columns. The first one captures the date and time (`timestamp`), the second one is the person who initiates a transfer of cash (`from_account`), the third one is the person who receives the cash (`to_account`), and the last column contains the amount transfered (`amount`). Each row in this table represents a transaction (i.e., an update in the database) and specifies that on a given day and time, money was transfered from one account to another. \n",

    "In the following paragraphs, we will use R to demonstrate how the exchange among Alice, Bob, and Christie could be enabled through a central electronic ledger. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A Time Stamped Transaction\n",
    "The equivalent of a database table or a spreadsheet in R is a data frame (`data.frame`). With the following example, we create such a data frame that has one line(row) and it captures the time stamped transaction between Alice and Bob.\n"

    "# Transactions Through Blockchain\n",
    "While transactions through a central electronic ledger have shown that it is possible to have cash-less transactions, one of the original issues remains. We still need a trusted third-part to maintain the single copy of the ledger (database). The most common scenario is that a bank is the trusted third-party and keeper of the ledger. However, this trust in the financial system was challenged during the financial crisis. This problem can be resolved by providing all participants with a copy of the ledger (hence, the term *distributed ledger*)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this solution solves a problem (i.e., need for trusted third party) by creating a new one (i.e., how to update and achieve a consistent distribution of the ledger across all network participants). In the case of a central ledger, a single  entity has been trusted with the task of maintaining the ledger. In the case of a distributed ledger, each network participant plays a role in making sure that the ledger is properly updated. Therefore, to the extent that blockchain provides a solution to this problem, blockchain is a technology for shared databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In blockchain when a new transaction is entered, it is not immediately retransmitted across the network. Instead, transactions are grouped and packaged into blocks. When a block reaches a certain size, then it is transmitted to the rest of the network. Each block contains timestamped transactions, the previous block's hash and a proof of work. As we will see in the following paragraphs, it is through this process that blockchain provides a robust solution to the shared database problem."
